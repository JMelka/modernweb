# Demo of Executing JavaScript outside of the browser

## Objectives:
* Opening terminal/prompt at this directory level
* Execute a simple JavaScript program
* Start and stop a server 

## Steps:
1. Open the terminal window at the same location as this file. You can do this by right-clicking on the README.md file and choosing Open in Command Prompt. (terminal)

1. Execute the program hello.js, using the node command
`node hello` or `node hello.js`

    Always be mindful where you are running your commands from!


1. Use an editor to modify `hello.js` to add your name to the console.log and re-run

1. In the editor, view the contents of `serverExample.js`

1. Use node to run this example. `node serverExample`

1. Open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and view the output. In VSCode you can use this link to open it. 

1. Change Hello World to Hello Universe. Refresh your brower, and notice you do not see the changes!

1. You need to stop and restart the server. Stop the server now, by clicking in the Integrated terminal window using Ctrl-C. This will stop the server and retain the current path.

1. Restart the server by hitting the up arrow to get to the last command which should be `node serverExample`

1. Check for the new output by refreshing the browser.

1. Make another change. This time stop the server by hitting the Trashcan icon, and reopening the terminal window - by right clicking the file and choosing to open the terminal window at this location.
