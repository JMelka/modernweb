# Chapter 5: Conditionals and Looping

## Steps

1. In `WIP/js` create a file called `conditionals.js` 

1. You can call the incoming data anything you want, it is your local reference to the data being passed in. 
         
1. In the function, print out the name by concatenating a string using + symbols with your variable to say:
    ```
    Hello, name-you-passed-in
    ```

## Bonus

1. Look up the formulas to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and vice-versa:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit

1. Write functions to take in one value and convert to the other.

1. Name them well, and inputs, and test that: 
    1. 212째F is 100째C
    1. 60째C is 140 째F
