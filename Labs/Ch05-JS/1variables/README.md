# Chapter 3C: JS variables

## Objectives
* Practice with JS variables

### Estimated Completion Time 
10 minutes
 
1. In `WIP` create a new folder called `js`

1. Create a file called `variables.js` 

1. Declare variables x,y,z
    ```javascript
    let x,y,z;
    ```

1. Set the value of x to 10, y to '10' (string) and z to 30
    ```javascript
    x=10;
    y = '10';
    z=30;
    ```

1. Use the `typeof` operator to check the types of each variable, printing the result to the console.
 ```javascript
    console.log(`x is ${typeof x}`);
    ```

1. Add this code:
```javascript
    var newX = x++;
```

1. Print the value using console.log - is it what you expect?

1. Use console.log to see the comparison and the result of x == y.
