## Objectives
* Add inline level elements to your document

### Estimated Completion Time 
10 minutes
 


1. In your `/WIP/html` open your file `mysite.html`.

1. Near the top of the document add a link to the 
 `recipes.html` - using the anchor tag, a relative link, and the text Recipes. If you did any bonus pages link these too.

1. Test your updates. Notice when you hover over the links the link is displayed in the bottom left.
 
 1. Modify your `/WIP/html/recipes.html` by adding  internal links to the individual recipes. Use the # symbol and id value for the internal link - and display the name of the recipe to be clicked.  

1. Search the web for a picture of a lemon bar. Download it to a new folder called images.

1. Next to the Lemon Bar recipe add the image you downloaded with an img element.  Use the src tag to make a relative reference into /images/your-image-name.png

1. Modify your recipe to use inline elements to make the ingredient measurements emphasized.

1. Mark your work ad complete

## Bonus

1. Add images for the other recipes. Display them smaller at the top of the page and wrap an anchor tag, to href to the recipe below.
