# Chapter 3: Practice with a table

## Objectives
* Add a table to your document

1. Copy the `table.css` from the `/Demos/Chapter03-HTML/tables` directory into your `/WIP/html` directory - for some better styling with standard table tags
 
1. In your `/WIP/html` add a file `bands-table.html` 

1. Open the image `bands-table.png`.  You will re-create this rendered table using EMMET abbreviations with a caption and <th> for headers.

1. Choose an element and add the attribute `title` with a value that describes the field - you can then hover over this in the browser for a tool tip type display.

1. Mark your work as complete

## Bonus

1. Create a table for the recipe data with columns for serving sizes, calories, etc.
