1. In your `/WIP` folder create a folder called `html` and a file inside called `mysite.html`. You will do your work in this `WIP/html` directory and file.

    Copy the code into the head section of your html file.

1. Download the zip file and use Windows Explorer to extract the files. (You can right click and choose open in Explorer in Windows). Ensure the files are moved into the same directory level as the html file.

1. If you open the browser now, you might see an error in the browser console. The generated code is assuming you are working on a server, and the / before the name of the file looks for the root. When using file:/ the root is c:\ !  Fix this by removing the slash from the href value.
