# Chapter 3: Practice with a table

## Objectives
* Add a table to your document

1. Copy the `table.css` from the `/Demos/Chapter03-HTML/tables` directory into your `/WIP/html` directory - for some better styling with standard table tags
 
1. In your `/WIP/html` add a file `table.html`. Choose the template with the white box and dotted bottom border.

1. Change the link to the `table.css` you copied, instead of `main.css`.

1. Open the image in this folder called `contact-info.png`.  

1. You will re-create this rendered table using EMMET abbreviations with a caption and <th> for headers.

    In the body area of your html file, copy the following line. It really activates when you are typing so, after you paste the following, hit the backspace and recreate the last character 3:
    ```
    table>tr*3>td*3
    ```

1. Add a caption element which is an immediate child of the table element. (Right after the opening `<table>` tag)

1. In caption add the text `Contact Info`

1. Mark your work as complete

## Bonus

1. Create a table for the recipe data with columns for serving sizes, calories, etc.
