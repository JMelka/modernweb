# Chapter 3: Practice with a table

## Objectives
* Add a table to your document

1. Copy the `table.css` from the `/Demos/Chapter03-HTML/tables` directory into your `/WIP/html` directory - for some better styling with standard table tags
 
1. In your `/WIP/html` add a file `bands-table.html`. Choose the template with the white box and dotted bottom border.

1. Change the link to the table.css you copied, instead of main.css.

1. Open the image in this folder called `bands-table.png`.  You will re-create this rendered table using EMMET abbreviations with a caption and <th> for headers.

1. In the body area of your html file, copy this line. It really activates when you are typing so, after you paste the following, hit the backspace and recreate the last character 3:
    ```
    table>tr*3>td*3
    ```

1. Mark your work as complete

## Bonus

1. Create a table for the recipe data with columns for serving sizes, calories, etc.
